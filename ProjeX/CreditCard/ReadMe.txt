I was asked to make this Case Study as a part of my INTERVIEW round,for the company RedCarpetUp.
 RedCarpetUp is a startup which lends to customers in India to finance their online purchases - ecommerce, travel, etc and now about the case study that I was given to work on, they asked me to do the following;
Analyzing an affiliated credit card (special card only available to members of a specific group). 
Think of it like this -
the credit card company is like Citibank and the affiliated group is a company like Indian Oil or Barista. The affiliated group has to pay some fees to credit card company (because the credit card company is providing this service to the group)
